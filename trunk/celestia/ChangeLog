Celestia Revision History
-------------------------

1.00
* Initial public release


1.01

* Made planets project shadows onto their rings (requires multitexturing)
* Detect and use ARB_multitexture extension
* Some configuration parameters now read from a file
* Support for multiple solar system catalog files
* Split solar system files into solarsys.ssc and extrasolar.ssc
* Added Help/License menu
* Added simple camera orbit mode
* Fixed up parsing and printing of catalog numbers--still kludgy though


1.02
* Made Celestia icon appear in corner of window.  Whee.
* Fixed an extremely subtle numerical precision bug which manifested itself in
  a number of ways:  jittering when following small objects, incorrect
  targeting of small objects with goto, occasional flashes when closely
  approaching an object, and probably other things as well.
* Reversed rotation directions when orbiting--it's much more intuitive now
* Added an exponential dolly capability to the camera
* Double-clicking will now center on the selected object
* Fixed bug in elliptical orbit calculation
* When orbits are displayed, the Orbit for the selected object is highlighted
* Incorporated Scott Hudson's asteroid geometry data for Toutatis, Kleopatra,
  and Geographos.
* Fixed problems with disappearing labels and with misplaced labels for
  extrasolar planets
* Eliminated 'sticking' when mouse buttons released outside of Celestia window
* Added Real Time option to Time menu
* Reversed planet rotation direction so it's correct.  Oops.
* Added about a dozen extrasolar systems from Jean Schneider's catalog

* Moved Selection class outside of Simulation, as it's generally useful


1.03
* Rotating the camera is now more responsive to mouse movement
* 'Infinite mouse' hack allows rotating and dollying without having to pick up
  the mouse and reposition the cursor in the window

  as points.  Small satellites will no longer get obscured by planets they're
  in front of.
* Apparent magnitude calculation for planets now takes into account phase
* At close range, stars are now rendered as textured sphere meshes.
* Choosing stars by catalog number no longer selects a star even when the specified
  star doesn't exist.
* Added labels for stars; the list of labelled stars is read from celestia.cfg
* Cleaned up vecmath.h, added consts and reference parameters where appropriate
* Cleaned up StarNameDatabase


1.04
* Start out at the moon instead of in deep space
* Made picking of planets work properly for planets with disc sizes greater than one
  pixel.
* Added call to glDeleteTextures to Texture class destructor

* Fixed orbital calculations for planets so their positions are now closer to
  reality.
