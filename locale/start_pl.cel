#  The lines of code above are the entire start.cel script. Below, is a     *
#  description of what each command does. We go to Sol first, so that when  *
#  we go to Earth, it will be displaying it's sunny side, regardless of     *
#  what your local time might be...                                         *
#                                                                           *
#  preloadtex: Tells Celestia to load the textures for the named object.    *
#          Otherwise Celestia would load the texture when the object        *
#          comes into view, which would be noticeable as a small delay.     *
#                                                                           *
#  select: Tells Celestia what object (planet, moon, spacecraft, etc.) to   *
#          define as the currently selected object. Sol defines our solar   *
#          system, the "/" character is merely a hierarchy divider, Earth   *
#          is the object we want to select. If you wanted to select our     *
#          Moon, the select command would look like the following:          *
#            select {object "Sol/Earth/Moon"}                               *
#                                                                           *
#  goto:   Tells Celestia to travel to the currently selected object, just  *
#          like pressing the "G" key on the keyboard. The time parameter    *
#          defines how many seconds it should take to travel there. The     *
#          distance parameter defines how far away from the object to be    *
#          positioned, in units of the object's radius, plus 1. For         *
#          example, if the object's radius is 10000 km, and you specify     *
#          6.0 for distance, you will be positioned 50000 km from the       *
#          center of the object.                                            *
#                                                                           *
#  wait:   Since the goto command is telling Celestia to take some time to  *
#          do something, we need to give Celestia that same amount of time  *
#          to actually DO it. When going to Sol, the wait command tells     *
#          Celestia to wait for 3 seconds while the goto takes place (for   *
#          3 seconds). The duration parameter value is normally the same    *
#          as the time parameter in the goto command. However, there are    *
#          always exceptions (grin).                                        *
#                                                                           *
#          When we are going to Earth, the wait command after the goto,     *
#          waits for only 2 seconds. The next command is a print command,   *
#          which displays some text on the screen and has another wait      *
#          command after it, that waits for another 3 seconds. It's all     *
#          just a matter of timing. The goto command allows us to display   *
#          some text on-screen WHILE it is executing. So, we simply make    *
#          sure that the total number of wait duration values, listed       *
#          after a goto, adds up to AT LEAST the time value specified in    *
#          the goto command. It can be longer, if desired.                  *
#                                                                           *
#  follow: Tells Celestia to follow the selected object through space,      *
#          just like pressing the "F" key on the keyboard. You could        *
#          replace the follow {} command with synchronous {}, which allows  *
#          you to remain in a stationary, or geosynchronous orbit above     *
#          the selected object.                                             *
#                                                                           *
#   print: Tells Celestia to display (print) some text on the screen. The   *
#          text parameter defines the text to be displayed. The row         *
#          parameter defines how many rows from the bottom of the window to *
#          start displaying the text at. The column parameter defines how   *
#          many columns from the left edge of the window to start           *
#          displaying the text. The duration parameter defines how many     *
#          seconds the text should be displayed on the screen. Which is     *
#          then followed by the wait command, as described above.           *
