# M.sin(i) has been used as an estimate of mass. Where this is greater than 11 jupiters, the
# body is rendered as a brown dwarf, since its true mass is likely to exceed the brown dwarf
# limit of 13 jupiters. When M.sin(i) is less than 0.02 jupiters (6 earths), the body is
# rendered as a terrestrial planet rather than a gas giant.
#
# Gas giant radii are usually unknown. Theoretical models are available, but depend on other
# unknowns - atmospheric composition, age, albedo and true mass. Radii have therefore been
# only roughly approximated here, since any more precise values would be misleading.
# Hot objects (>800K) have a radius of 1.4 jupiters if M.sin(i) is less than 1.2 jupiters, and
# a radius of 1.2 jupiters if they are more massive. At temperatures between 500K and 800K, these
# same objects are assigned radii of 1.2 and 1 jupiters, respectively. Cold objects have a radius
# of 1 jupiter unless M.sin(i)<0.7, at which point radius is reduced to 0.8 jupiters.
# Planets with a mass less than 0.075 jupiter masses (24 earth masses) have been assigned radii
# which give them a density comparable to Mercury or Earth. Of this group, those with a mass
# greater than 6 earth masses are textured as 'super-terrestrial' worlds with thick atmospheres;
# those with masses less than 6 earth masses are given a cloudless cratered texture. The cut-offs
# at 24 and 6 earth masses are made without any theoretical support, purely for the sake of
# illustration and variety.
#
# Planetary rotation periods have been estimated from the tidal spin-down formulae in 'Solar
# System Dynamics' by CD Murray & SF Dermott, Cambridge University Press 1999, ISBN 0521 57597 4.
# The results are highly approximate - spin-down time is fixed at 4 billion years, and initial
# rotation rate has been set to 10 hours for objects with M.sin(i) > 0.3 jupiters (by analogy
# with Jupiter and Saturn), 17 hours for lower-mass giants (by analogy with Uranus and
# Neptune), and 5 hours for terrestrials (by analogy with the estimated primordial rotation
# period of Earth). The various bulk planetary parameters necessary for the calculation have been
# set equal to those of Jupiter (gas giants) or Mars (terrestrials). Bodies in close orbits are
# generally in captured synchronous rotation, while outer-system bodies retain their primordial
# rotation periods. Objects with intermediate orbits are tidally slowed to various extents.
#
# Oblateness is consistent with the estimated mass, radius and rotation period, if the bulk
# parameters are assumed to be similar to those of Jupiter (gas giants) or Earth (terrestrials).
# An oblateness value is assigned only if the calculated value exceeds 0.01.
#
# Imaginary textures are assigned to giant planets based on their estimated temperatures,
# according to the five categories set out by D Sudarsky, A Burrows & P Pinto in 'Albedo and
# reflection spectra of extrasolar giant planets'(Astrophysical Journal 2000; 538: 885-903):
#      http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/309160
# Color values and albedos are based on the theoretical reflectance spectra given in that paper.
# Planets with an estimated temperature greater than 1000K have been assigned a glowing nightside
# texture.
#
# For most extrasolar planets, the position of the pericenter and the mean anomaly are known,
# but the actually orientation and inclination of the orbit in the plane of the sky are unknown.
# These objects have been left with their orbital planes in the default position (the ecliptic
# plane), but their pericenters and anomalies are correctly rendered. For transiting planets
# the true inclination is known, but the orientation of the orbit in the plane of the sky is not.
