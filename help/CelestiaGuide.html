                                            Celestia comes in a number of pre-built packages for multiple operating systems. Due to the large file size, many Celestia distributions have split this into two sections.  One section is the Celestia program.  The second section is content files with planet maps, stellar names/positions and some simple spacecraft.  See <a href="#morecontent"><u>Additional Celestia Content</u></a>.

                                            <b>NOTE:</b> Celestia has a number of helper applications - including SPICE support, audio support, video recording support and Lua scripting support. Pre-built packages have options selected when they were prepared. You may desire different options, and compiling from source gives you more flexibility to make a custom version of Celestia. The Celestia sources are found at the Celestia GitHub repository.  Instructions on compiling the source code is found in the <b>Install</b> file with the code.

                                                    - Release version <b>1.6.x</b> is available in the native Windows User Interface. For Win64(x64) it can be found at the Celestia web site in the downloads section. It is also available from the Microsoft store. Other sites contain pre-built versions with special options, including a Win32(x86) version. Check the Celestia forums for additional links and downloads. After downloading the installation executable, run the .exe file to install Celestia. Celestia 1.6.x will work when installed in any version of Windows from Vista and later; however, more recent releases of Celestia are geared to and tested on recent releases of Windows. If you are running an older version of Windows, you may need to run a previous version of Celestia. <i>Be aware that Windows is protective of software installed in the Program Files directory tree.</i> You will have far fewer problems modifying Celestia if you install it somewhere else, for example creating the folder "C:\MyPrograms" and installing Celestia there. The installation program will let you browse to wherever you want to install Celestia.

                                                    - Developmental version <b>1.7.x</b> is available in both native Windows user interface and Qt 6 user interface. The compiled files are found on the Celestia GitHub repository through GitHub actions and require a GitHub account (free) to download. From the Celestia GitHub page, click on the <i>Actions</i> link at the top. You will be presented with a list of recent workflows. Click on the link to the workflow from the latest update (near the top of the list). Under <i>Artifacts</i> there are two sets of files beginning with "celestia-windows-x64" (64-bit) or "celestia-windows-x86" (32-bit). Both user interfaces for that version of Windows are available as separate files. First create a folder for programs, for example "C:\MyPrograms". In this folder create a new folder named "Celestia".

The Celestia program can be started by clicking on the <i>celestia-win.exe</i> file in the Celestia folder. You can create links or menu items to this file for easier starting. <b>Note:</b> Be sure your active directory is the Celestia folder when starting Celestia - or configuration files, data files, textures and models will not be found.

The Celestia program can be started by clicking on the <i>celestia-qt6.exe</i> file in the Celestia folder. You can create links or menu items to this file for easier starting. <b>Note:</b> Be sure your active directory is the Celestia folder when starting Celestia - or configuration files, data files, textures and models will not be found.

Many Linux distributions maintain a copy of Celestia in their software repositories, see the repository content lists for your distribution. There is also an experimental AppImage file which is a single executable file for the GTK interface with the program, data content and most of the libraries needed to run it on many Linux distributions. It can be found at <u><a href="https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/munix9/AppImage/">https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/munix9/AppImage/</a></u>. Simply download the AppImage file, change the file properties to executable, and execute the program. The program is not limited to the planetary textures and spacecraft found in the program release, but can access <a href="#morecontent"><u>additional Celestia content</u></a>. The AppImage program responds to the <a href= "#cmdlineoptions"><u>Command Line Options</u></a> of its GTK user interface. By using the <i>dir</i> and <i>extrasdir</i> options you can create directories to access additional data, images, scripts and models from the AppImage.

                                                    <b>Note:</b> You must separately obtain and install openGL and the libraries needed for each user interface. There are several optional helper programs to Celestia - these may/may not have been compiled into your Celestia version.  They will require additional libraries. These will be found in your Linux distribution's software repository. Often the package manager (software install program) for a Linux distribution has automated these repositories, so installing Celestia will automatically call for, download and install the additional needed packages.

Both are needed for Celestia to work properly.

                                            Celestia can be started either by clicking on its icon or by typing a command into a terminal window. Under Windows, the terminal window is often called a DOS window or CMD window or Powershell. When starting from the command line, a series of options (switches) can be used to modify the behavior of Celestia. These options are different depending on which interface Celestia was built for. Options used by the programming language are activated first, followed by application options. The options for the Celestia application are as follows:

                                            Celestia will start up in a window, and if everything is working correctly, you'll see Earth in front of a field of stars. Displayed on-screen, is some information about your target (Earth), your speed, and the current time (Universal Time, so it'll probably be a few hours off from your computer's clock).

                                            Right drag the mouse to orbit Earth and you might see the Moon and some familiar constellations. Left dragging the mouse changes your orientation also, but the camera rotates about its center instead of rotating around Earth. Rolling the mouse wheel will change your distance to Earth--you can move light years away, then roll the wheel in the opposite direction to get back to your starting location. If your mouse lacks a wheel, you can use the <b>Home</b> and <b>End</b> keys instead.

                                            When running Celestia, you will usually have some object selected. Currently, it's Earth, but it could also be a star, moon, spacecraft, galaxy, or some other object. The simplest way to select an object is to click on it. Try clicking on a star to select it. The information about Earth is replaced with some details about the star. Press <b>G</b> (or use the <i>Navigation menu</i>), and you'll zoom through space toward the selected star. If you press <b>G</b> again, you'll approach the star even closer.

                                            Press <b>H</b> to select our Sun, and then <b>G</b> to go back to our Sun. Right click on the sun to bring up a menu of planets and other objects in the solar system. After selecting a planet from the menu, hit <b>G</b> again to travel toward it. Once there, hold down the right mouse button and <i>drag</i> to orbit the planet.

                                            The <i>Tour Guide</i> is a list of some of the more interesting objects you can visit in Celestia. Select the <i>Tour Guide</i> option in the <i>Navigation menu</i> to display the Tour Guide window. Choose a destination from the list, click the <b>Goto</b> button, and you're off.

                                            By default, the Star Browser window displays a table of the 100 nearest stars, along with their Distance, Apparent and Absolute Magnitude, and Type. Clicking on the column headers will sort the stars. The table is not continuously updated, so if you travel to another star, you should press the <b>Refresh</b> button to update the table for your current position. The radio buttons beneath the table let you switch between viewing a list of Nearest, Brightest, or <i>With planets</i> stars.

                                            As with the solar system browser, clicking on any star name in the table will select it.  Use this feature along with the <b>Center</b> and <b>Go To</b> buttons to tour the stars visible from any night sky in the galaxy.

                                            <h3>Solar System Browser</h3>
                                            The Solar System Browser displays a window with a tree view of all the objects in the nearest solar system (if there is one within a light year of your current position.) Clicking on the name of any object in the window will select it.  You can then use the <b>Center</b> or <b>Go To</b> buttons to display that object in the main Celestia window.

                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Choose <i>Select Object</i> from the <i>Navigation menu,</i> type in the object name, and click <b>OK</b></li>
                                                <li>Press <b>Enter</b>, type in the entire object name, and press <b>Enter</b> again</li>
                                                <li>Press <b>Enter</b>, type in the first few characters of the object name, press the <b>Tab</b> key to move through the displayed listing until the object is highlighted, then press <b>Enter</b> again</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            You can use common names, Bayer designations or catalog numbers for stars. Celestia currently supports the HIP, HD and SAO catalogs. Catalog numbers must be entered with a space between the prefix and the catalog number.

                                            You can modify how Celestia starts up each time you run it, by defining your own start-up settings. Simply open the file "start.cel" in a plain text editor and follow the in-file instructions. Also, view the celestia.cfg file in a plain text editor to see additional settings.

                                            Celestia allows you to easily add real, hypothetical, or fictional objects by creating new catalog files. It is <b>not</b> recommended that you alter the built-in data files; nearly all desired modifications and additions can be made by placing new catalog files in Celestia's extras folders. There are three types of catalog files:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><b>ssc</b> (solar system catalog: planets, moons, spacecraft, etc.)</li>
                                                <li><b>stc</b> (star catalog)</li>
                                                <li><b>dsc</b> (deep sky catalog: galaxies, star clusters, and nebulae)</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            All three types of catalog file are text files that can be updated with your favorite text editing program.

                                            The files for Celestia have grown to a large size, causing some distributions to split the files into two separate files - one for the program and one for the data/models/textures. Most releases of version 1.6.x are of a single file, and the GitHub source is one single site. Beginning with version 1.7.x the Celestia GitHub repository has been split into two sites, the original GitHub repository that contains the program (CelestiaProject/Celestia), and a new content repository (CelestiaProject/CelestiaContent). In order for Celestia 1.7.x to run, the files from both sites must be combined. Many distributions provide the separate data content files already pre-packaged. If these are not available, then go to the Celestia content repository and click on the green "Code" button in the upper right corner. Select the download as zip file option, and download the content file. Unzip this file to find the CelestiaContent-master directory. The directories that must be added to the main Celestia program (install) directory are:
                                            <br>
                                            <br>* data
                                            <br>* extras
                                            <br>* extras-standard
                                            <br>* models
                                            <br>* textures

                                            <b>Note:</b> If multi-language support is desired, the CMAKE program can be run to generate language files from the <i>po</i> directory and individual languages can be installed.

                                            Celestia also has a wide and talented user community. This community is constantly updating content, producing highly detailed models (many are spacecraft), improved planetary textures and incorporating recent astronomical discoveries. Their work can be found on multiple websites. The Celestia Forum has many spacecraft models and other addons for Celestia. This includes highly detailed models of the International Space Station, the Chinese Space Station Tiangong, the Hubble Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope and most of the spacecraft that have been flown or are in development. The Celestia MotherLode has spacecraft, including ships from fictional universes such as Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5 and 2001. The Celestia Mobile site has a collection of spacecraft and astronomical objects found under the "Addons" tab. The Celestia Origins project seeks to update the astronomical database of Celestia with planetary/moon locations, recently discovered moons and other objects. There are several efforts to add a large database of newly discovered exo-planets to Celestia. Searching for Celestia on the internet will give multiple sites to find additional content.

                                            <h3>Answer:</h3>
                                            Your computer's graphics drivers are obsolete. Celestia makes use of the most advanced features of OpenGL that the graphics driver claims to support. Modern drivers require that the program (Celestia) specifies the version of vertex shader routines that it uses. Obsolete drivers don't recognize that specification. When vertex shaders generate an error message, Celestia draws the object bright red.

                                                Download and install current drivers for free from the Web site of the manufacturer of your graphics hardware.

                                                If you are using Windows make sure that you have disabled the feature to download graphics drivers from Microsoft. Those drivers have an outdated version of OpenGL included. Always use graphic card drivers from either the graphics card manufacturer or better directly from graphics chip manufacturer (i.e. NVIDIA, ATI/AMD, Intel, ...).

                                            Your graphics chipset and its OpenGL drivers aren't drawing bumpmaps and normalmaps properly: their OpenGL routine "GL_ARB_vertex_program" is defective. (This is often seen with the newer Intel graphics chips.)

                                            Any graphics card with at least 128MB of memory and support for OpenGL 2.0 pixel shaders will be able to show everything that Celestia is visually capable of.

                                            Look for a graphics card that advertises either support for Direct3D shader model 2.0 or higher. Almost all graphics cards being sold today meet this requirement, albeit with varying degrees of performance. High-end NVIDIA and ATI cards will provide the best experience in Celestia. NVIDIA's OpenGL drivers have tended to have fewer bugs than ATI's.

                                            <b>a)</b> Only NVIDIA 5000 series or greater (e.g. 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 250) cards with 128MB of memory or more will show all of the eye	candy drawn by Celestia v1.4.0 or later.

                                            ATI Radeon 9500 and above, including the X series, are comparable to NVIDIA FX 5nnn series cards in functionality, although performance differs. However, not all of the eye candy drawn by Celestia is compatible with them.

                                            <b>b)</b> Graphics cards with drivers that support OpenGL v2.0 will show all. Graphics cards that support only v1.4 will show most, but not all, eye candy.

                                            E.g. NVIDIA GF4 Ti 4xxx series cards cannot show smooth shadow borders. Starting with Celestia v1.4.0, smooth shadow borders can be drawn by any card which supports OpenGL v2.0.

                                                <li>Textures on Rings, 3D Mesh models, and moving Clouds are limited to the size of your card's texture buffer. This limitation does not apply to the surface textures of spherical planets and moons.</li>

                                            <br>
                                            Most ATI cards, including the X series, cannot show surface texture images larger than 2K (2048 pixels on the longer side) on a side on Rings, on 3D Mesh models, or on moving Clouds. Unfortunately, some addons include 4K (4048) pixel textures. Those addons only work with NVIDIA 4nnn, 5nnn, 6nnn and 7nnn cards and with ATI X1800 and above with ATI's most recent graphics drivers. Those cards have 4K texture buffers.

                                            In order for Celestia to be able to show bumpmap shadows and specular reflections, your card's OpenGL library must support OpenGL v1.4. In particular, it needs to include "GL_ARB_vertex_program".

                                            The human eye can adapt to a very wide range of illuminations, so it wouldn't be as dark out there as you think &#8211; about the level of moderate indoor lighting, in which you can see very well. At the other end of the scale, your computer monitor is physically incapable of generating the brightness of illumination that pertains on the inner planets.

                                            The real things <b>are</b> dim, grey blobs. Your eyes are not sensitive to color at the very low light levels emitted by distant galaxies. Many of the colorful pictures you're used to seeing are enhanced by long exposures on sensitive color film. Others are imaginative "false color" combinations of narrow-band CCD images designed to make visible the specific features of interest to the investigator. The colors of those pictures aren't realistic at all.

                                            You have a misaligned map.
                                            <br>
                                            Celestia requires that all maps have 0 degrees of longitude in the center, with 180 degrees of longitude at the edges. All of the surface texture image maps of all of the moons and planets that come with Celestia have this alignment.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            In contrast, many maps of Mars were created with 0 degrees of longitude at the left and right edges, and with 180 degrees of longitude in the center.

                                            Using a map with 0 at the edge would cause the symptoms you describe.

                                                You need to find a map that's properly aligned or you need to cut the map in half and exchange the halves.

                                                For example with Photoshop's '<I>Offset</I>' filter is quite easy to modify maps that are misaligned by 180 degrees. In Photoshop CS2, select <I>Filter/Other/Offset</I> and set the horizontal offset amount to half the texture width.

                                            Many sources for planetary maps (such as the USGS) use a mapping convention called "ecliptic north" &#8211; the north pole of any planet or asteroid is defined as being whichever rotational pole points north of the plane of the ecliptic (the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun). Each planet or asteroid can then be classified as a "direct" rotator, if it rotates in the same direction as the Earth when observed from above its north pole (i.e. counterclockwise); or as a "retrograde" rotator, if it rotates in the opposite direction.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            In contrast, Celestia uses an equally valid mapping convention called "rotational north" &#8211; north is defined as being the pole around which the planet appears to rotate counterclockwise, irrespective of that pole's orientation relative to the ecliptic.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            For direct rotators, this difference is irrelevant &#8211; "north" turns out to be the same direction in both mapping conventions. But for retrograde rotators, Celestia's north pole corresponds to ecliptic south &#8211; so you will find many maps of retrograde rotators like Venus, Ida and the moons of Uranus that appear to be upside down relative to those in Celestia.

                                            <h3>Answer:</h3>
                                            The version of Celestia supplied in the package manager or the <I>Add/Remove programs</I> menu is broken. Celestia's textures are included in the package celestia-common-nonfree which is not listed as a dependency of the main program, so is not installed by default.

                                                Sometimes a bright area is recorded where the file requestor menu or any other window overlaps Celestia's main window. This bug seems to be fixed since Celestia v1.4.0, but if it happens here are some tips for avoiding this problem.

                                                <b>a)</b> The problem will often go away if you toggle "Show Galaxies" off and on again before you take your snapshot. Either use the <i>Render/View Options</i> menu or type the letter <b>[U]</b> twice before you press <b>[F10]</b>.

                                                <b>b)</b> Run Celestia in windowed mode, not full-screen. Drag the file requestor away from in front of the main window before you click on "Save".

                                                <b>c)</b> If your graphics card supports it, you can connect a secondary display. Some CRTs are very inexpensive. Drag the file requestor to the other screen.

                                                <br>Windows includes a "print-screen" command. Under XP, you can use the keyboard combination <b>[Ctrl+Print-Screen]</b> to write the screen image to the clipboard. You can then use any Paint program and Paste the image into it.

                                                This is a bug in Celestia. To make a good clean screenshot image, press <b>[Ctrl + D]</b> before you capture the image. This cancels Multiview.

                                            Depending on the brand of laptops and the used card, it may take special action to update graphics drivers by the standard ones from the NVIDIA site. Normally, for these laptops, one has to update the drivers from the vendor's site instead. The reason is that in such cases, the laptop requires a modified .inf file together with the standard driver. This typically happens in case of NVIDIA GO graphics cards!

                                            For example only most recent DELL machines work with the standard drivers from the NVIDIA site. These cases are listed explicitly by NVIDIA ...

                                            A typical signature for the situation is a message like the following during the installation of the standard NVIDIA driver:

                                            Shut down all background programs on your system before running Celestia (i.e. antivirus software, multimedia software such as REAL Player, Musicmatch, etc.).

                                            Graphics programs are notorious for consuming system resources and even the best of graphics cards are better off without competing for those resources.

                                            Celestia makes use of the most advanced features of OpenGL that your computer's graphics driver claims to support. Many older OpenGL implementations have serious bugs.

                                            Celestia uses 100% of the CPU if it cannot finish recalculating what's shown in its window before your computer decides it's time to refresh the screen.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Celestia has to recalculate the positions and visibility of everything you see in its window every time your system refreshes its screen. If you have set the screen refresh rate to be 75Hz, then Celestia has to recalculate everything in 1/75 of a second. If it finishes recalculating everything before the screen is refreshed, then it will use less than 100% of the CPU. If it takes longer, then it will use 100% of the CPU and Celestia will redraw its window more slowly than the screen's refresh rate.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            In a dual processor or dual-core system or in a hyperthreaded system simulating a dual processor system, 100% of one of the CPUs is shown as 50% of total system usage. The calculations in Celestia are single-threaded and cannot make use of more than one CPU at a time.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Type a <B>[`]</B> (= backslanted apostrophe = accent grave) to enable Celestia's fps (frames per second) display in the lower left corner. If you have a keyboard that supports diacritical marks, then you may need to type a <B>[SPACE]</B> after the <B>[`]</B>.

                                            On most systems Celestia will use no CPU time if its window has been iconized or minimized. (Under Windows, click on the icon in the upper right corner of Celestia's window which has an underscore in it.)
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Also check if vsync is enabled in the Windows control panel (this is the default setting.) If vsync is not enabled, Celestia will render frames as fast as it can, even if this is faster than the rate at which the monitor can display them.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            You also can make Celestia use less of the CPU if you ask it to draw less. Some ways to do this are:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>reduce the screen refresh rate</li>
                                                <li>reduce the size of the window</li>
                                                <li>reduce the size of objects drawn in the window so fewer stars and galaxies are obscured</li>
                                                <li>reduce the number of stars and galaxies being obscured by turning down the limiting magnitude (type a <B>[</B> several times) or by disabling them entirely</li>
                                                <li>reduce the number of objects being drawn by loading fewer addons.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <br>
                                            Otherwise, consider upgrading your CPU so more can be calculated between screen refreshes. Upgrading the graphics card will help somewhat, depending on how many OpenGL functions get moved from software into hardware.

                                            <h3>Answer:</h3>
                                            Celestia's primary star catalog is based on the Hipparcos database of stars with accurately measured distances. Hipparcos was not used to measure the distances to many dim, variable or close double stars.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            More recent versions of Celestia include all of the stars within 20 LY of the Sun, as well as about 200 double stars. (There are actually many more double stars than that, but relatively few have had their orbital parameters accurately measured.)
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Another possibility is that Celestia does not know this name of the star that you are looking for. A lot of stars have more than only one name/designation, some even more than 30. If you can't find the name that you are looking for, try an online resource like <a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/">SIMBAD</a> to find other names for the star.

When you want to select a Star that has only a HIP or HD catalog number, you must type its complete designation, including a space between HIP (or HD) and its number:

                                                <i>[return]</i>
                                            </span>
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Strings which only match entries in the binary stars.dat database or in one of the cross-index databases for HD and SAO designations are not shown by the tab-completion code. There are too many of them. Only names which are in an object's quoted textual name string in a textual catalog (SSC, STC or DSC) are listed by the tab-completion code.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            A confusion factor is that some Stars have HIP designations specified as their quoted names, often with no space between HIP and the number. Only these quoted HIP names are shown in the tab completion line. Some examples are in /data/visualbins.stc.

                                            Up to version 1.5.1 Celestia had technical limitations which prevented it from drawing stars beyond a distance of about 16,000 LY from the sun.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Since version 1.6.0 Celestia is technically capable of displaying stars without a distance limitation. However, since Celestia is scientifically orientated only stars that have a precise measurement of their position are included in the star database of the official releases.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            With increasing distances of the stars from the Earth the measuring error of a star position gets huge, so it is not possible to exactly say where the star should be. Those stars are not included in Celestia and this criterion is also the reason why there are no stars displayed in other galaxies.

                                            When invoked from a command line, Celestia can be passed the name of a .CEL or .CELX script to run at startup:

                                            When the command line includes the qualifier "--once", the command line will be passed to the running copy of Celestia instead of starting a new copy of the program. (note: two hyphens)

                                            Mir along with other spacecraft models were modeled within an historical time frame and can only be viewed from their starting date to their ending date.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Celestia will show those spacecraft only if you set the time to be somewhere between those two dates. Celestia does not display spacecraft if they are not in orbit at the time of the simulation.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            For example, Mir was launched on February 20, 1986, and reentered the Earth's atmosphere on March 23, 2001, at 05:55 GMT. This is controlled by Beginning and Ending directives in the definition of Mir in solarsys.ssc. If you remove those statements, Celestia will always draw Mir in orbit.

                                            <br>
                                            You can override ending dates by opening the solarsys.SSC or other specific craft related .SSC files and placing a pound sign (#) in front of the ending date string. Then save the new setting. This way you can always view your installed Space Crafts. Consequently, removing the pound sign will return the craft to it's natural time frame.

                                            The orbit of the ISS changes continuously in ways that are almost impossible to predict due to things like atmospheric drag, light pressure, cargo ship docking, etc. If you want an accurate orbit, you'll have to update it on a daily basis.<br>

                                            Also, don't forget that Celestia models the shape of the Earth using a spheroid. The actual shape of our planet is much more complicated.

                                            As a result, a view from the Earth's surface in Celestia is not accurate enough to show the correct path across the sky of satellites in low Earth orbit like the ISS. In other words, you can't use Celestia to find out where to look in the sky to see the ISS.

                                            It's likely that this is correct behavior. The distance between the planet and the star it orbits is probably much less than the distance from the planet to the second star. If the stars are approximately equal absolute brightness, this means that the light from the closer star will be so much more intense than the light from the more distant star that the secondary illumination will be imperceptible.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Remember that the brightness of light falls off in proportion to one divided by distance squared. If the second light source is a lot further away than the primary, it must be intrinsically much brighter in order to visibly illuminate a planet.

                                            Only the OpenGL 2.0 render path handles shadows correctly when there is more than one light source. In the other render paths, only the shadow from the brightest light source is considered. The OpenGL 2.0 path can render ring shadows and up to three eclipse shadows per light source.

                                            Their diameters are exactly right. As seen from the earth, they are both about a half-degree across. Celestia's window is about 45 degrees across, so the Sun and Moon are about 1% of that. They are drawn only 10 pixels wide if your screen is 1024x768.

                                            Remember that your computer screen is only about 10-20 degrees wide in your own field of view. Celestia's 45 degree field provides a "wide angle" view of the sky. This makes objects look smaller than you might expect.

                                            The apparent large size of the Sun and Moon as we see them in the sky is a psychological illusion. There are several different explanations for this. If you take a picture of the moon with a camera lens that has the same field of view as Celestia, you may be surprised at the small size of its image.

                                            You can have more than one copy of Celestia on your system at the same time.

                                                <li>
                                                    Verify that things still work:
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Double-click on the icon for <I>Celestia151\Celestia.exe</I> and look around in your universe.</li>

                                                <li>Install the new copy of Celestia and tell it to use the directory <I>Celestia</I>. It'll create the folder again and install itself there.</li>

                                            Always use only lower case letters and numbers in file names. Use only the underscore <B>[_]</B> as word separators, not spaces. Avoid using composite characters.

                                            Too often people are careless with filenames when creating addons. The capitalization of names must be consistant for an addon to work under all operating systems.

                                            <br>
                                            <i>My_Addon.dsc</i> is not the same as <i>my_addon.DSC</i> and not the same as <i>my_addon.dsc</i>. They are names for different files.

                                            Linux and other Unix derived operating systems can tell the difference between upper and lower case. Linux can have three different and separate files with those names.

                                            in the catalog file, then the filename must be <I>texture.jpg</I> in the textures folders. If the file is named <I>Texture.JPG</I>, Celestia won't find it because that's not the file that it's looking for.

                                            SPICE is a project of the NASA Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF). It allows calculations of positions and velocities of planets, satellites, comets, asteroids and spacecraft. It is used by NASA, ESA, JAXA and other space agencies as well as individual space missions. It consists of a "SPICE toolkit" of computer software and "SPICE kernels" or data files. SPICE kernels are available from multiple mission websites as well as the main NAIF website <a href="https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/"><u>https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/</u></a>.

                                            <br>
                                            SPICE data is highly detailed, and will provide improved positional accuracy over the standard Celestia positioning model. It can be incorporated into the *.ssc Celestia data files. There is also a spice2xyzv tool that converts SPICE kernels to a Celestia xyzv format. See the Celestia WikiBooks for information on obtaining and using SPICE data.

                                            The answer to that question is twofold.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            1. If the pictures and movies were created by you by using <b>only</b> the official distributed copy of Celestia they are yours to do with as you want. In any case if you are using pictures/videos made with Celestia you have to recite Celestia as the origin.
                                            <br>

                                            A lot, if not all problems described are due to the fact that windows doesn't allow data to be placed in the program files directory. That is part of the security system (UAC) and can be turned off completely, or partly.

                                            To enhance compatibility and still use UAC Microsoft implemented a work-around for programs, by redirecting data into the "compatibility" directory.

                                            Another way would be to install the complete Celestia program, including its sub-directories anywhere, away from the "<I>Program Files</I>" directory. Some people have reported having fewer problems if they install Celestia somewhere else than in "<I>Program Files</I>".

                                            The administrator rights are caused by the installation itself. Celestia wants to retain its <B>own</B> authorities when you install it, and that creates these problems. The only way to fix it is to either reset the permissions which you cannot do unless you <B>have</B> the administrator rights, or you can <B>copy</B> the files to a location that you have created yourself.

                                            These are runtime files of Microsoft Visual C++, the programming language used to compile Celestia. They are not shipped with Windows, although some programs do come with them. You need to add them to your computer.

                                                Microsoft has a download site with a "Visual C++ Redistributable" file in Win64(x64) and Win32(x86) versions. You must select a Visual Studio version of 2015 or later. As the files are backwards compatible, it is best to use the most recent version. Download and run the file to install the needed dlls.

                                                To avoid having to deal with all of these "permissions" issues, Windows users (on a single home PC) can simply copy a SSC file to a different directory.

                                                You will be asked if it's okay to allow this copy, and you can respond Yes. Once you have done this you will be able to edit the copied file in the Celestia directory without trouble.

                                            Beginning with Windows Vista, the compatibility directories are created when you try to install Celestia as an application defined as being associated with a previous version of Windows, i.e. XP, 98, etc.
                                            <div class="solution">
                                                <h3>Solution:</h3>
                                                Most of the compatibility directories will not be created if you install Celestia as a native Windows Vista application.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                Running Celestia in the native Vista mode seems to work pretty well. You may find also that you can simply move a compatibility file from its current location (once it has been created) into the standard Vista <I>C:\Program Files\Celestia</I> directory where you wish it to be. Once done, it will usually stay where you put it unless it is again acted upon by a non-Vista program.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>If you also use other programs to perform functions like editing plain text SSC files using previous Windows version compatible programs, these will also cause compatibility directories. So, it is the best to use Vista-ready programs for all of the Celestia-related functions.

                                            These files are "hidden" in the normal Vista environment (and in Windows Explorer) if you use the default values of Windows.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            If you want to see these files, or to see if there are any compatibility files in use, here is a short explanation of how to enable the view of "hidden" files in Vista's Explorer.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            With standard installation of Windows your compatibility files should generally be found under the User's Folder. These compatibility files cannot be seen unless the user has the ability (using Windows Explorer) to show the hidden files.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            This is done (in Windows Explorer) by clicking on the "<I>Tools</I>" option on the Explorer Menu, followed by "<I>Folder Options</I>", "<I>View</I>", then clicking on "<I>Show hidden files and folders</I>" and finally clicking on "<I>Apply</I>" in order to show these files and folders.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            After this has been done, you can then look to the previously hidden folder named "<I>AppData</I>" to see if compatibility files are in use for Celestia.

                                            On occasion Vista creates copies of your textures or other Celestia files when they were modified. Your new textures may not show up in the Celestia textures directory, but may be transported to an entirely different directory used for compatibility issues.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Some textures will show up in the compatibility directory, and others will show up where you saved them in the Celestia directory.

                                            In order to use the 3dstocmod converter in Vista, you have to convert the elements via Vista's "compatibility" mode under the file's "properties" dialog.

                                            Celestia will crash if you do not have up-to-date graphics drivers. The graphics drivers included with Windows are frequently buggy and <B>not</B> up-to-date. You must download and install updated drivers from the Web site of the manufacturer of your graphics hardware.

                                            <br>
                                            Do <b>NOT</b> use Microsoft offered graphics drivers, since they frequently have not the support for the latest OpenGL features, even if your graphics card is capable of providing them.

                                            Cel:// URLs work fine under Windows with MS Word.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            MS Word automatically requires the use of <B>[Ctrl]</B> + click to launch a hyperlink, but there is a menu item to eliminate the need to press <B>[Ctrl]</B>.
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Go to the "<I>Tools/Options/Edit</I>" menu, and uncheck the box that says, "<I>Use Ctrl+Click for hyperlinks</I>".</li>
                                                <li>Click <I>OK</I>.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            From that point forward, simply pointing and clicking once on a cel:url or hyperlink will launch it.

                                            Since Vista, Windows enforces some security requirements which usually are optional under earlier versions of Windows. You may have to select options to disable that enforcement for Celestia. E.g. allowing URLs to run programs.

                                Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                                of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                                Preamble
                                The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                                freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                                License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                                software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                                General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                                Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                                using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                                the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                                your programs, too.
                                When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                                price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                                have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                                this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                                if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                                in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                                To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                                anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                                These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                                distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                                For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                                gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                                you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                                source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                                rights.
                                We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                                (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                                distribute and/or modify the software.
                                Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                                that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                                software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                                want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                                that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                                authors' reputations.
                                Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                                patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                                program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                                program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                                patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
                                The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                                modification follow.
                                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                                TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                                0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                                a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                                under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                                refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                                means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                                that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                                either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                                language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                                the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                                Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                                covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                                running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                                is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                                Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                                Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
                                1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                                source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                                conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                                copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                                notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                                and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                                along with the Program.
                                You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                                you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
                                2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                                of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                                distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                                above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                                a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                                stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                                b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                                whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                                part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                                parties under the terms of this License.
                                c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                                when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                                interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                                announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                                notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                                a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                                these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                                License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                                does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                                the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                                These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                                identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                                and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                                themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                                sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                                distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                                on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                                this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                                entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
                                Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                                your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                                exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                                collective works based on the Program.
                                In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                                with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                                a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                                the scope of this License.
                                3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                                under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                                Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
                                a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                                source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                                1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
                                b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                                years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                                cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                                machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                                distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                                customarily used for software interchange; or,
                                c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                                to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                                allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                                received the program in object code or executable form with such
                                an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                                The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                                making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                                code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                                associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                                control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                                special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                                anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                                form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                                operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                                itself accompanies the executable.
                                If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                                access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                                access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                                distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                                compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                                4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                                except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                                otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                                void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                                However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                                this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                                parties remain in full compliance.
                                5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                                signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                                distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                                prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                                modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                                Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                                all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                                the Program or works based on it.
                                6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                                Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                                original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                                these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                                restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                                You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                                this License.
                                7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                                infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                                conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                                otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                                excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                                distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                                License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                                may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                                license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                                all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                                the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                                refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
                                If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                                any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                                apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                                circumstances.
                                It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                                patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                                such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                                integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                                implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                                generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                                through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                                system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                                to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                                impose that choice.
                                This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                                be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                                8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                                certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                                original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                                may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                                those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                                countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                                the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                                9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                                of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                                be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                                address new problems or concerns.
                                Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                                specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                                later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                                either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                                Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                                this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                                Foundation.
                                10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                                programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                                to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                                Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                                make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                                of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                                of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                                NO WARRANTY
                                11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                                FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                                OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                                PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                                OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                                MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                                TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                                PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                                REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                                12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                                WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                                REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                                INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                                OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                                TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                                YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                                PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                                POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</textarea>
