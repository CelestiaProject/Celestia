Development snapshots installation on Windows:
* https://bintray.com/celestia/celestia-builds/snapshots contains
  official 32/64 bit development snapshots for Windows.


To build from sources please follow instructions below.



Common building instructions
----------------------------

We recommend using a copy of out git repository to build your own installation
as it contains some dependencies required for building.

To create the copy install git from your OS distribution repository or from
https://git-scm.com/ and then execute the following commands:
* git clone https://github.com/CelestiaProject/Celestia
* git submodule update --init

If you have fmtlib and Eigen3 installed from other sources (OS repository or
vcpg) or don't want to build Celestia with SPICE support then you can skip the
2nd step.



Celestia Install instructions for UNIX
--------------------------------------

First you need a C++ compiler able to compile C++11 code (GCC 4.8.1 or later,
Clang 3.3 or later), CMake, GNU Make or Ninja.

Then you need to have the following devel components installed before Celestia
will build: OpenGL, glu, glew, theora, libjpeg, and libpng. Optional packages
are fmtlib, Eigen3, Qt5, Gtk2 and glut.

For example on modern Debian-derived system you need to install the following
packages: libglew-dev, libjpeg-dev, libpng-dev, libtheora-dev, libgl1-mesa-dev,
libglu1-mesa-dev. Them you may want to install libeigen3-dev, libfmt-dev;
qtbase5-dev, qtbase5-dev-tools and libqt5opengl5-dev if you want to build with
Qt5 interface; libgtk2.0-dev and libgtkglext1-dev to build with legacy Gtk2
interface; or freeglut3-dev to build with glut interface.

OK, assuming you've collected all the necessary libraries, here's
what you need to do to build and run Celestia:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -DENABLE_INTERFACE=ON [*]
  make
  sudo make install

[*] INTERFACE must be replaced with one of "QT", "GTK", or "GLUT".

Three interfaces are available for Celestia on Unix-like systems:
- GLUT: minimal interface, barebone Celestia core with no toolbar or menu...
       Disabled by default.
- GTK: A full interface with minimal dependencies, adds a menu, a configuration
       dialog some other utilities. Legacy interface, may lack some new
       features. Disabled by default.
- QT: A full interface with minimal dependencies, adds a menu, a configuration
      dialog some other utilities, bookmarks... A preferred option. Enabled by
      default, No need to pass -DENABLE_QT=ON.

Starting with version 1.3.1, Lua is the new scripting engine for Celestia,
the old homegrown scripting engine is still available. By default Lua support
is enabled, it can be disabled passing -DENABLE_CELX=OFF to cmake.
Versions 5.1, 5.2 or 5.3 of Lua library is required. On Debian-based systems
either one of liblua5.3-dev, liblua5.2-dev or liblua5.1-dev should be installed
to have Lua support.

To check wether your Celestia has been compiled with Lua support, go to File
-> Open. If you have '*.cel *.celx' in the filter box, then Lua is available
otherwise the filter will contain only '*.cel'.

The GtkGLExt widget that is required in order to build Celestia with Gtk+ may
be downloaded from http://gtkglext.sf.net. Note that depending in your
distribution you may also need other packages containing various files needed
by the build process. For instance, to build under SUSE Linux, you will also
need to have the gtk-devel package installed.

Celestia will be installed into /usr/local by default, with data files landing
in /usr/local/share/celestia, but you may specify a new location with the
following option to cmake: -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/another/path.



Celestia Install instructions for Windows (MSVC)
------------------------------------------------

Currently to build on Windows you need a Visual Studio 2015 or later, CMake
and vcpkg (*).

Install required packages:

  vcpkg install libpng libjpeg-turbo gettext lua fmt glew eigen3

Install optional packages:

  vcpkg install qt5 luajit

Configure and build 32-bit version:

  md build32
  cd build32
  cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=c:/tools/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ..
  cmake --build . --  /maxcpucount:N /nologo

Configure and build 64-bit version:

  md build64
  cd build64
  cmake -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=c:/tools/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ..
  cmake --build . --  /maxcpucount:N /nologo

Instead of N in /maxcpucount pass a number of CPU cores you want to use during
a build.

If you have Qt5 installed using official Qt installer, then pass parameter
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to cmake call used to configure Celestia, e.g.

  cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\Qt\5.10.1\msvc2015 ..

Not supported yet:
- automatic installation using cmake
- using Ninja instead of MSBuild

Notes:
 * vcpkg installation instructions are located on
   https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg



Celestia Install instructions for Windows (MINGW64), qt-only
------------------------------------------------------------

It is recommended to build the source with MSYS2
https://www.msys2.org/ .

Do the following in the MINGW64 shell (mingw64.exe).

Install required packages:

  pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
  pacman -S base-devel
  pacman -S git
  pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
  pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5
  pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-freeglut mingw-w64-x86_64-glew mingw-w64-x86_64-lua
  pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libtheora mingw-w64-x86_64-mesa

Install optional packages:

  pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-fmt mingw-w64-x86_64-eigen3 mingw-w64-x86_64-luajit

Clone the source and go to the source directory.

Configure and build:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -G"MSYS Makefiles" -DENABLE_WIN=OFF
  mingw32-make.exe -jN

Instead of N, pass a number of CPU cores you want to use during a build.

To build in debug configuration, you have to use lld linker instead of the
default linker in gcc.

  pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-lld mingw-w64-x86_64-lldb

Follow by: 

  cmake .. -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DENABLE_WIN=OFF -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-fuse-ld=lld' -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

Then do mingw32-make.exe.



Celestia Install instructions for macOS, qt-only
--------------------------------------

Currently Qt frontend is the only available option for macOS users building
Celestia from source.

Install the latest Xcode:

  You should be able to get Xcode from the Mac App Store.

Install required packages:

  brew install cmake cspice fmt gettext glew libpng lua qt5 jpeg eigen

Clone the source and go to the source directory.

Configure and build:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DENABLE_SPICE=ON ..
  make -jN

Instead of N, pass a number of CPU cores you want to use during a build.

Install:

  make install

Celestia will be installed into /usr/local by default, with data files landing
in /usr/local/share/celestia, but you may specify a new location with the
following option to cmake: -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/another/path.

To build the application bundle, pass -DNATIVE_OSX_APP=ON to the cmake command,
the application bundle will be located in the "build" folder that you previously
created.

 *** Ignored on Unix-like systems.

Parameters of type "bool" accept ON or OFF value. Parameters of type "path"
accept any directory.

On Windows systems two additonal options are supported:
- CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM - can be set to x64 on 64-bit Windows to build
  64-bit Celestia. To build 32-bit Celestia it should be omitted.
- CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE - location of vcpkg.cmake if vcpkg is used.



Executable files
----------------

As said prevously Celestia provides several user interfaces, accordingly with
interfaces it's built with it has different executable files installed to
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin (e.g. with default CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX on
Unix-like systems they are installed into /usr/local/bin).

Here the table which provides executable file names accordingly to interface:

| Interface | Executable name
+-----------+-----------------
| Qt5       | celestia-qt
| GTK       | celestia-gtk
| GLUT      | celestia-glut
| WIN       | celestia-win
