Celestia Install instructions for UNIX
--------------------------------------

You need to have the following components installed before Celestia
will build: OpenGL (tested with Mesa 3.4), glu, glut, libjpeg, and libpng.
Should you have a package based installation (most Linux distributions these
days are), you will also need to install the devel packages for your OpenGL,
glu, glut and glibc packages.

OK, assuming you've collected all the necessary libraries, here's
what you need to do to build and run Celestia:

	configure
	make
	make install

Celestia can be built with or without support for Gtk, by default the Gtk+
version will be built if you have Gtk+ and GtkGLArea available, otherwise it
just uses GLUT and has no GUI. If you need/want to build the non-Gtk+ version
even though you have Gtk+ and GtkGLArea, run configure with --without-gtk:

	configure --without-gtk

The GtkGLArea widget that is required in order to build Celestia with Gtk+ may
be downloaded from http://www.student.oulu.fi/~jlof/gtkglarea/ . Note that
depending in your Installation Distributions you may also need other packages
containing various information needed by the build process, for instance, to
build under SUSE Linux, you will also need to have the gtk-devel package
installed, and having GNOME's devel packages present also is probably not
a bad idea (in fact, currently absolutely necessary for the GTK version).

Celestia will be installed into /usr/local by default, with data files landing
in /usr/local/share/Celestia , but you may specify a new location with the
--prefix option to configure:

	configure --prefix=/home/my_directory

All the other usual configure parameters apply; you may see which options
are available using 'configure --help'

If while running configure you see an error reporting that gl.h,
is missing, you either don't have OpenGL installed on your system,
or you don't have the corresponding devel package installed.  If for
instance you have Mesa installed, you will also have to install the
mesa-devel package (or something named similarly).  Missing glu.h or glut.h
means that you don't have GLU, GLUT, or their devel pacakges installed.
